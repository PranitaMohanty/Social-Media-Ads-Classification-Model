# Social Media Ads Classification Model

Social media ads classification models are algorithms designed to classify ads on social media 
platforms into different categories or predict their performance based on various features such 
as demographics, ad content, and user behavior. These models use techniques like machine 
learning, natural language processing, and deep learning to analyze large datasets and make 
predictions about ad performance or target audience engagement. Popular classification 
algorithms used for this purpose include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, 
support vector machines, and neural networks. These models help advertisers optimize their ad 
campaigns, improve targeting, and increase return on investment
